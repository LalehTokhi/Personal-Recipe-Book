<h2>Cooking Steps:</h2>

<p>First, steam the lamb meat in a large pot with plenty of water until it is
     partially cooked. Then, remove the meat from the water and set it aside.
    Next, chop the onions and fry them in oil until they become dark in color.
     After that, add the tomato paste and mung beans on top of the fried onions.
      Once these ingredients are slightly fried in the oil, add the meat broth
       (the water we previously set aside).Now, add cinnamon, cardamom, and salt
        to the mixture. Once the water starts boiling, add the rice that has been
         soaked in water beforehand. Let the rice cook in this water until it is
          nearly cooked and the water evaporates. Once the water is mostly dried up,
           place the lamb meat on top of the rice and cover the pot. Let it steam for
            about an hour, and after one hour, the dish is ready to be served. </p>
