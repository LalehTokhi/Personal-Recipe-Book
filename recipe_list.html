<dt><h3>Kechiri Gosht Land</h3></dt>

<dd>This is a traditional Afghan dish with an amazing and unique taste,
    commonly enjoyed in different regions of Afghanistan. To prepare this dish,
     pieces of meat are first coated with flour and salt, then left to dry
      naturally for several days. This drying process gives the meat a special
       texture and rich flavor. Once the meat is fully dried, it is cooked
        together with rice, allowing the rice to absorb the delicious taste of
         the meat. The result is a flavorful and hearty meal that reflects the
          authentic taste of Afghan cuisine.</dd>
